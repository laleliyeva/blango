
The Logic of GenericForeignKey and GenericRelation
This repository contains the logic used to link various models to a common model through GenericForeignKey and GenericRelation.

What is GenericForeignKey?
In Django, GenericForeignKey is a type of relationship that allows a model to dynamically connect to multiple other models. It enables linking objects of different types with a single foreign key.

How Does It Work?
content_type: A reference that stores the type of the related object (ContentType model).
object_id: An integer field that stores the primary key of the related object in the specific model.
GenericForeignKey: Combines these two fields to identify which object is being referenced.
